# Type @ Cooper West
## Introduction to Python, February 2018

Welcome to the class!

This repository will be used to share links, code examples, and resources during the workshop. The goal will also be for it to serve as a basis for continued learning after the weekend is over, with a collection of links to other resources and learning materials to continue where the workshop has left off.


## Resources to continue learning:

### Python Basics

Since we started learning Python by using [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com/), you can also use the [Python Courseware](http://www.drawbot.com/content/courseware.html) from DrawBot to learn, or relearn, the basics of the Python language.

The Python community is huge, and its reach is much larger than just the type design community. By just searching for "learn python" you'll find plenty of guides and courses for getting started, such as [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) or a class at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).

Because the community is so large, you'll learn that you can usually find a quick and easy answer with a Google search. When we were looking to find everything that the "random" module would do, a search for "python random" found [the documentation for "random" on python.org](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html)


### DrawBot

The [DrawBot website](http://www.drawbot.com/) is also your reference for drawing. In the navigation along the left side, you'll find the documentation for drawing shapes, setting text, working wth images. 

There's also a [quick reference](http://www.drawbot.com/content/quickReference.html) also gives a pretty good summary for the basics all in one page.

Find inspiration from how others use DrawBot with [Just van Rossum's Daily Drawbot project](http://dailydrawbot.tumblr.com/) or follow [@drawbotapp](https://twitter.com/drawbotapp) on Twitter
