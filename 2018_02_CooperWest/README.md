# February 2018 â€” Type @ Cooper West, Introduction to Python

Welcome to the class!

This repository will be used to share links, code examples, and resources during the workshop. The goal will also be for it to serve as a basis for continued learning after the weekend is over, with a collection of links to other resources and learning materials to continue where the workshop has left off.
