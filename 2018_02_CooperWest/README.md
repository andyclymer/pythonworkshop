# Type @ Cooper West
## Introduction to Python, February 2018

Welcome to the class!

This repository will be used to share links, code examples, and resources during the workshop. The goal will also be for it to serve as a basis for continued learning after the weekend is over, with a collection of links to other resources and learning materials to continue where the workshop has left off.


## Resources to continue learning:

### Python Basics

Since we started learning Python by using [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com/), you can also use the [Python Courseware](http://www.drawbot.com/content/courseware.html) from DrawBot to learn, or relearn, the basics of the Python language.

The Python community is huge, and its reach is much larger than just the type design community. By just searching for "learn python" you'll find plenty of guides and courses for getting started, such as [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) or a class at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).

Because the community is so large, you'll learn that you can usually find a quick and easy answer with a Google search. When we were looking to find everything that the "random" module would do, a search for "python random" found [the documentation for "random" on python.org](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html)


### DrawBot

The [DrawBot website](http://www.drawbot.com/) is also your reference for drawing. In the navigation along the left side, you'll find the documentation for drawing shapes, setting text, working wth images. 

There's also a [quick reference](http://www.drawbot.com/content/quickReference.html) also gives a pretty good summary for the basics all in one page.

Find inspiration from how others use DrawBot with [Just van Rossum's Daily Drawbot project](http://dailydrawbot.tumblr.com/) or follow [@drawbotapp](https://twitter.com/drawbotapp) on Twitter


### Working in RoboFont

There's a lot of documentation on the kinds of tools that type designers use at [http://robodocs.info/](http://robodocs.info/). In class, we were using the ["RoboFab Documentation"](http://robodocs.info/roboFabDocs/source/index.html).

As a reminder, the general principle is that you treat all of the parts of the font as if they're an object, where each object has a set of "attributes" that describe the object (the glyph's width, the font's path), and "methods" which are the functions that the object knows how to do (glyph can scale itself or interpolate with another glyph, etc.). So, click in to the [Objects](http://robodocs.info/roboFabDocs/source/objects/index.html) section of the documentation to find what "RFont" and "RGlyph" objects can do.

So where to go from here? Maybe try a few of the examples in the [Step By Step](http://robodocs.info/roboFabDocs/source/talks/index.html) section of the RoboFab docs.
