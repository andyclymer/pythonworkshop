# Text Processing, Sample Texts

### ScrabbleWordList.txt

All 178691 words that are allowed to be used in an official game of Scrabble. Could be a good starting point for preparing a sample text for proofing.

### MiniWordList.txt

Ten words from the Scrabble Word List for each letter of the alphabet. A lot easier to get started on processing with Python before loading up the full list.
